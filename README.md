# Gesture-Volume-Control-OpenCV
This project enables gesture-based control of computer volume using hand tracking. By utilizing a hand-tracking module, it detects key hand landmarks to recognize gestures. Moving the hand closer or farther adjusts the volume, creating a seamless, hands-free experience. The modular approach simplifies the development process.
